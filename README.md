# LandingPage
Dear Sir/Madam,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I have successfully completed the task of developing the landing page, and I would like to provide an overview of the work done.
This is a webpage for a delivery service called "Express Delivery". It features a form for scheduling deliveries, where users can input their full name, email address, phone number, and delivery address.
The page also includes a tagline "Get Your Deliveries Fast & Safe" and "Delivering happiness to your doorstep", emphasizing the speed and security of their service.
The zip file attached contains both the frontend and backend code for the project. 
If you have any questions or need further details regarding the implementation, please feel free to ask. I would be happy to assist.

Thank you for the opportunity to work on this task. I look forward to hearing your feedback.

Best regards,
Gagana
